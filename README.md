# Bootstrap 4 RTL
- Latest dist.: [Version 4.3.1 (Official, ~~Weekly build~~<sup>1</sup>) + RTL 4.3.1 rev. 16 (Unofficial)](http://bootstrapper.ir/archive/bootstrap-4.3.1-plus-rtl-rev.16-dist.zip)
- Visit [full documentaions<sup>2</sup>](http://docs.bootstrapper.ir/) in RTL direction. (English docs)
- Visit [example pages<sup>3</sup>](http://example.bootstrapper.ir/) in RTL direction.

## RTL Hints:
  - Use this package like official package.
  - Use `<html ... dir="rtl" ... >` for correct PRINT layout and also, because of MS IE/EDGE layout engine RTL capabilities.
  - Use UTF-8 encoding.
  - Always follow XHTML rules.

## Usage:
  - Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm i @laylazi/bootstrap-rtl`
  - Reference to latest version/revision on UNPKG CDN: [https://unpkg.com/@laylazi/bootstrap-rtl/](https://unpkg.com/@laylazi/bootstrap-rtl/)

## In case of adapting/converting Bootstrap&copy; 4.x templates:  
  - Replace all official `bootstrap.css` references by `bootstrap-rtl.css` in all HTML files.
  - Inside every HTML file, find these direction specific CSS class names and change them:
    - from `border-left` to `border-right` and vice versa.
    - from `border-left-0` to `border-right-0` and vice versa.
    - from `rounded-left` to `rounded-right` and vice versa.
    - from `float-left` to `float-right` and vice versa.
    - from `ml-*` to `mr-*` and vice versa.
    - from `pl-*` to `pr-*` and vice versa.
    - from `text-left` to `text-right` and vice versa.
    - from `text-*-left` to `text-*-right` and vice versa.
    - from `dropleft` to `dropright` and vice versa.
    - from `dropdown-menu-left` to `dropdown-menu-right` and vice versa.
    - from `dropdown-menu-*-left` to `dropdown-menu-*-right` and vice versa.
  - Also, to correct **Popovers** / **Tooltips** direction, change all `data-placement="left"` to `data-placement="right"` and vice versa.
  - After that, use [RTLCSS<sup>4</sup>](https://rtlcss.com/playground/) to adapt / convert all customized css codes to RTL edition.

## Important:
  1.  As you know, [TWBS](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) had changed their policies about development and maintenance of version 4.x and they will merge shipped changes in official `v4-dev` branch. Because of their unplanned merges, next RTL revisions will not have been provided weekly. 😞
  2. [RTL documentations](http://docs.bootstrapper.ir/) is now online. 😈😎
      - RTL docs have been tested on IE 11, Edge 18, latest Edge insider (Dev & Canary channels), latest Firefox, and latest Chrome.
      - Edge 12-18 has issues about RTL direction and sticky position
      - ~~New chromium based Edge (Dev and Canary channels) have an issues about RTL direction and flexbox layouts.~~ [it is resolved now](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Discussions/Bug-Edge-Dev-FlexBox-RTL-Direction-Incorrect-Layout/m-p/714493).
      - Documentation layouts have ~~not~~ been reviewed completely and it is ~~in progress~~ done!
  3. [RTL docs](http://docs.bootstrapper.ir/) and [RTL example pages](http://example.bootstrapper.ir/) ~~will be~~ are combined ~~ASAP~~ now.
  4. [RTLCSS](https://github.com/MohammadYounes/rtlcss) is an impressive tool 🤯 created by [Mohammad Younes](https://github.com/MohammadYounes).

Bundled JS files (`bootstrap.bundle.js` and minified `bootstrap.bundle.min.js`) include [Popper](https://popper.js.org/), but not [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

## Documentation

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <https://getbootstrap.com/>. The docs may also be run locally.

Documentation search is powered by [Algolia's DocSearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/). Working on our search? Be sure to set `debug: true` in `site/docs/4.3/assets/js/src/search.js` file.

### Running documentation locally

1. Run through the [tooling setup](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/build-tools/#tooling-setup) to install Jekyll (the site builder) and other Ruby dependencies with `bundle install`.
2. Run `npm install` to install Node.js dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to compile CSS and JavaScript files, generate our docs, and watch for changes.
4. Open `http://localhost:9001` in your browser, and voilà.

Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

### Documentation for previous releases

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](https://semver.org/). Sometimes we screw up, but we adhere to those rules whenever possible.

See [the Releases section of our GitHub project](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases) for changelogs for each release version of Bootstrap.
